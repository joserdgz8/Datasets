This .csv file contains the results of a study of how tree seedling traits vary with elevation in the Andes.

There are 10 sites (`A:J`). `A` is the lowest elevation, `J` is the highest elevation. 

Each species (`AV`, `CR`, `CT`, `DL`, `HG`, `ID`, `MS`, `SP`, `TG`) is sampled at three sites, the `Top`, `Middle`, and `Bottom` of their range (`Species.elevation.code`).

At each of their three elevations, each species is sampled 10 times.

***

`Latitude.DD` and `Long.DD` are given in Decimal Degrees.

`Soil.temp.mean` and `Soil.temp.SD` are the mean and standard deviation of three soil temperature measurements, respectively.

`Num.leaves` is the number of leaves per seedling

`Width.mm` is the stem width of the seedling in mm.

`SPAD.mean` and `SPAD.SD` are the mean and standard deviation of three measurements of leaf green-ness (proxy for chlorophyll content), respectively.

`Num.seedlings.comp` is the number of other understory herbaceous plants found within a 1 m radius of the seedling.
