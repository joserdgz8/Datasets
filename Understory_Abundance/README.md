This .csv file contains the results of a simple abundance survey in a woodland-scrub mosaic ecosystem in the United Kingdom.

In the woodland, three 100 m^2 patches were chosen, each dominated by a different tree species.

Plot:

- A = _Populus Tremula_

- B = _Crataegus monogyna_

- C = _Fraxinus excelsior_

***

In each of these patches, four 1 m^2 quadrats were placed using a random number table on a co-ordinate grid system (S1, S2, S3, S4).

All visible angiosperm species were identified to species, all bryophytes were identified as "Moss". 

All individuals of a species were counted (Abundance_). Moss was not given an abundance value as individuals could not be distinguished.

The percentage cover of each species was estimated (Per_Cover_). Total percentage of each quadrat equal more than 100% due to overlapping areas.

All species were placed on the subjective ACFOR scale (Abundant, Common, Frequent, Often, Rare).
