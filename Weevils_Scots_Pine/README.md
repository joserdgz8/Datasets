This .csv file contains the results of a common garden experiment in which seeds of genetically distinct populations of Scots Pine (_Pinus sylvestris_) were cultivated in an experimental plot. Pine Weevils (_Hylobius abeitis_) were deliberately introduced to assess the resilience of the populations to Pine Weevil infestation.

Each of the 21 populations (`A:U`) are divided further into eight genetically distinct families (`A_a:u_j`).
Each population contains 32 individuals.
Each family contains 4 individuals.

Seedlings were planted in a blocked randomised grid.

Four blocks each contain 168 individuals, 672 individuals in total. `location_code` gives a unique number to each individual (`1:672`).

Blocks are arranged along a soil moisture gradient, with block 1 being the wettest and block 4 being the driest.

`x_coord` and `y_coord` values are carried over between plots.

The number of lesions caused by weevil attack were counted on each individual, lesions were classified by damage from the current year (`current_damage`) and healed damage from the previous year (`previous_damage`).
